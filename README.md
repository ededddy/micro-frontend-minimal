# Usage

1. Use `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn` to install packages on all `app-{}`, `app-{}/`,and
   `shell`

2. Build packages for `app-{}`. You will see `dist/bundle.js`showing up
   in the app root folder.

3. Run `pnpm start` or `npm startor` or `yarn start` in each `app-{}/server/` to start up the
   applet providers.

4. Run `pnpm start` or `npm startor` or `yarn start` in `shell` and see
